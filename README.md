# Jira Dashboard

FastAPI + React dashboard that connects directly to Jira Server via REST API.

## Stack

| Service  | Tech                      | Port  |
|----------|---------------------------|-------|
| api      | Python 3.12 / FastAPI     | 8000  |
| frontend | React / Vite / Tailwind   | 5173  |

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 18+
- Access to a Jira Server instance

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Enter project directory
cd jira-dashboard

# 2. Create env file and fill in your credentials
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Install API dependencies
cd api && pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Start the API
python3 -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

# 5. In a second terminal, install and start the frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

## Dashboards

| URL                            | Description                        |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `/dashboard/overview`          | KPIs across all projects           |
| `/dashboard/velocity`          | Sprint velocity (committed vs done)|
| `/dashboard/burndown`          | Active sprint burndown chart       |
| `/dashboard/backlog`           | Backlog health by type/priority    |
| `/dashboard/team`              | Workload per team member           |

Most teams in this Jira instance estimate and log work in **hours**
(`timetracking`), not story points, so Velocity and Burndown use hours as
the primary metric — story points are shown alongside as a secondary value
only when a project actually has them loaded.

- **Velocity / Burndown**: since several boards in this instance are shared
  across multiple projects, both pages let you pick a specific
  Tablero (board) → Sprint instead of guessing. Issues are fetched through
  Jira's own board-scoped endpoint (`board/{id}/sprint/{id}/issue`), so the
  numbers reflect that board's real filter (project/assignee/component) —
  picking a different board for the same project genuinely changes the
  result, it isn't cosmetic.
- **Carga de equipo (Team)**: toggle between **Sprint actual** (issues in
  the project's currently active sprint(s)) and **Backlog total** (all
  unresolved issues) — a person's numbers can look very different between
  the two, so both are available rather than only one.
- **Resumen (Overview)**: each project card's "Velocidad"/"Burndown"/"Equipo"
  links switch the active project before navigating — they used to be plain
  links that always showed whichever project happened to be the app's
  fallback.
- No dashboard shows placeholder or demo data — Sprint Dashboard used to
  show a hardcoded example (fake KPIs, fake people, fake project keys)
  before a board+sprint was picked; it now shows an empty state instead.

## JSON API

| Endpoint                                          | Description                                   |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `GET /api/overview`                                 | Global KPIs                                    |
| `GET /api/velocity/{project}?board_id=`             | Velocity data (hours primary, points secondary)|
| `GET /api/burndown/{project}?board_id=&sprint_id=`  | Burndown data (hours primary, points secondary)|
| `GET /api/backlog/{project}`                        | Backlog distribution                           |
| `GET /api/team/{project}`                           | Team workload — `{sprint, backlog}` per person |
| `GET /api/sprint-dashboard/data`                    | Sprint dashboard (board+sprint)                |

`board_id`/`sprint_id` are optional; when omitted the API falls back to the
project's first board and its active sprint.
